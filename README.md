  # Titanic Disaster Machine Learning
<h2> Introduction </h2>
The Titanic Disaster Machine Learning project is a data science and machine learning project that aims to predict the survival outcomes of passengers on the ill-fated RMS Titanic. This project utilizes the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset widely used in the machine learning community, to build and evaluate predictive models.
<h2> Project Overview </h2>
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, leading to the deaths of a significant portion of its passengers and crew. This project leverages historical data about the passengers to predict whether a given passenger survived or not.

<h2> Features </h2>
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
Machine Learning: Utilizing various classification algorithms to predict survival.
Evaluation: Model performance assessment using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
Visualization: Visualizing the data and model outcomes.

###<h2>Requirements</h2> 
* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

#### Getting Started
To get started with the Titanic Disaster Machine Learning project, follow these steps:
1- Clone the repository to your local machine:
